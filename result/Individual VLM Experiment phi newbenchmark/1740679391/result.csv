Therefore, the main camera movement is a leftward rotation.",None

This suggests that the camera has moved to the right, rotating slightly to capture the target image. The office chair and desk are still visible in both images, but their positions have changed slightly, indicating a rotation rather than a translation.",None

This is evident from the position of the objects and the angle at which they are presented. For example, the chair and the computer desk are rotated to the left, and the backpack is now on the left side of the image instead of the right. The overall layout and orientation of the objects suggest a leftward rotation.",None

This suggests that the camera has rotated from left to right. The position of the objects in the room, such as the desk and the chair, also supports this inference. The desk and chair are positioned in a way that suggests a left-to-right rotation. Therefore, the main camera movement from the source image to the target image is a leftward rotation.",None
