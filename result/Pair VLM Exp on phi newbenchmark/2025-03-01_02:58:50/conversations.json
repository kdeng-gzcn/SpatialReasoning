The angle of view has shifted slightly, providing a more direct and possibly more detailed view of the steps. The background remains out of focus, but the change in distance and angle could affect the perception of depth and the overall composition of the image.\n\nBoth images show the steps in a straight line, ascending from the bottom to the top, indicating that the camera's movement was primarily vertical.

The objects in the kitchen area that are slightly out of place or displaced are all moving in a rightward direction, with the bottle and bowl moving to the right, and the spoon moving to the left. This suggests that the camera may have rotated to the right, causing these objects to appear displaced.\n\nI'm making this guess because the objects are not moving in a uniform pattern, but rather seem to be scattered randomly. This could be due to the camera movement causing the objects to appear displaced, rather than any intentional movement of the objects themselves. Additionally, the fact that the objects are all moving in a rightward direction suggests that the camera movement may be a rotation rather than a translation.\n\nI'd like to ask one more question to VLM to confirm my guess:\n\n<ques>Can you provide more information about the relationship between the sofa and the kitchen area in more detail?

Now suppose you are chatting with your friend, formulate questions for your friend. "

The consistency in the background, the lack of noticeable changes in lighting or shadows, and the similarity in the positioning of the objects on the desks all suggest that the camera has remained stationary.\n\nAlthough VLM mentions the possibility of a tiny movement, the overall layout of the room and the positioning of the objects suggest that any movement of the camera was minimal and did not significantly affect the objects on the desks. The slight differences in the positioning of the objects could be due to the camera's angle or the objects being slightly moved by the person in the image, but this does not indicate a significant camera movement.\n\nGiven the consistency in the images, I believe that the most likely option is that the camera has not moved at all from the source image to the target image."

Although you can't see the pair of images directly, you have a friend Vision Language Model (VLM) who can answer all the questions that you ask about the images. My suggestions are: 1. to find out the main objects occur in both images; 2. find out the positions of the objects inside the image; 3. judge the movement of camera from source image to target image based on information you get. For more information: 1. you can have several turns of conversation with VLM if you like; 2. the task is not hard because the camera movement is limited to only be one of six direction (three translations and three rotations), e.g. only left or right translation/translation. Now suppose you are chatting with your friend, formulate questions for your friend. "

This implies that the camera has moved in a way that has changed the relative positions of the objects in the scene. The fact that the refrigerator and sink have also changed positions, with the refrigerator moving from left of the sink to right of the sink, and the sink moving from right of the refrigerator to left of the refrigerator, further supports this conclusion.\n\nGiven that the camera movement is limited to only six directions (three translations and three rotations), I infer that the camera has moved in a way that is consistent with a leftward rotation. This is because the coffee machine has moved closer to the camera, which suggests that the camera has rotated to the left to capture the scene. The changes in the positions of the refrigerator and sink also support this conclusion, as they would be expected to move in this way if the camera were rotating to the left.</rsn>\n\nNo additional questions for now!"

The red cabinet and the black appliance have both moved to the right, which suggests a rightward movement. The fact that the white dishwasher has not changed its position or orientation further supports this conclusion. Therefore, I can confidently conclude that the main camera movement from the source image to the target image is a rightward rotation.</rsn>\n\n(Note: I'm not asking any additional questions at this point, as the VLM's description provides sufficient information to infer the camera movement.)"

This is because the mannequins' heads are turned slightly to the left in both images, and a rightward rotation would bring their heads to a more forward-facing position, which aligns with the VLM's description.</rsn>\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely convinced by this conclusion, and I'd like to ask more questions to confirm my judgment.

            "text": "You are tasked with spatial reasoning evaluation, i.e. infering the camera movement from a source image to a target image. Although you can't see the pair of images directly, you have a friend Vision Language Model (VLM) who can answer all the questions that you ask about the images. My suggestions are: 1. to find out the main objects occur in both images; 2. find out the positions of the objects inside the image; 3. judge the movement of camera from source image to target image based on information you get. For more information: 1. you can have several turns of conversation with VLM if you like; 2. the task is not hard because the camera movement is limited to only be one of six direction (three translations and three rotations), e.g. only left or right translation/translation. Now suppose you are chatting with your friend, formulate questions for your friend. "

I'll ask a series of questions to gather information about the source and target images.\n\nTurn 1:\nHey VLM, can you tell me what are the main objects that appear in both the source and target images? Are there any specific objects, like people, buildings, or vehicles, that are present in both images?"

            "text": "Your friend, the Vision Language Model (VLM), has provided the following information about the images. He said, \"In both the source and target images, the main objects that appear are the red cabinets, the black countertop, and the white sink. The red cabinets are positioned in the background, while the black countertop and white sink are in the foreground. The white sink is located on the left side of the countertop, and the black countertop extends to the right side of the image. There are no people, buildings, or vehicles visible in either image. The camera movement appears to be a left translation, as the position of the red cabinets and the white sink have shifted to the left in the target image compared to the source image.\" Based on this, please choose one of the following options to determine the main camera movement from the source image to the target image: (0) ask more questions; (1) no movement; (2) leftward rotation; (3) rightward rotation. Provide your answer inside the special tokens <ans></ans>, e.g. <ans>0</ans>, and explain your reasoning inside the special tokens <rsn></rsn>, e.g. <rsn>My reason is...</rsn>. If you choose the option that asks more questions, you may ask additional questions to VLM inside the special tokens <ques></ques>, e.g. <ques>My questions are...</ques>. Note that your judgment should be based on the positions and movements of objects in the images as described by the VLM. "

However, the VLM also mentioned that the position of the red cabinets and the white sink have shifted to the left in the target image compared to the source image. This suggests that the camera has actually moved to the right, not the left. Therefore, I believe the correct answer is a rightward rotation."
