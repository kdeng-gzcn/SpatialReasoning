The slight offset in the position of the door and the wall in the target image can be attributed to the camera rotation around the counter, which changed the perspective without moving the door and the wall. This suggests that the camera movement is a rotation, but the direction of the rotation is not clear from this information alone. However, based on the fact that the door appears to be in a similar position relative to the counter in both images, I'm leaning towards the option that the camera has not moved at all.",
