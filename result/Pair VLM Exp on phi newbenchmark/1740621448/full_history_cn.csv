Although you can't see the pair of images directly, you have a friend Vision Language Model (VLM) who can answer all the questions that you ask about the images. My suggestions are: 1. to find out the main objects occur in both images; 2. find out the positions of the objects inside the image, e.g. there is a box on the left side of source image, and the same box is on the right side of target image; 3. judge the movement of camera from source image to target image based on information you get. For more information: 1. you can have several turns of conversation with VLM if you like; 2. the task is not hard because the camera movement is only by one of six direction (three translations and three rotations), and here you just need to judge if the camera is rotating leftward or rightward from source to target.

<rsn>Although VLM mentioned that the red cabinets and black countertop are static and do not indicate any movement, this information does not provide enough evidence to determine the camera movement. Since the objects are static, it's possible that the camera moved in any of the three translation directions (up, down, or side to side) or one of the three rotation directions (up, down, or around the center). I need more information to narrow down the possible movements.</rsn>

<rsn>VLM has provided additional information about the positioning of the red cabinets and black countertop, and it seems that they remain in the same location in both images. Since there are no noticeable changes in their positioning, it's likely that the camera did not move at all. The information provided does not suggest any rotation or translation of the camera, so I conclude that the camera movement is ""no movement"" (option 1).</rsn>"

<ques>Can you please tell me more about the positions of the objects in the source and target images?

3. There are no significant changes in the positions of the objects on the countertop between the source and target images.

<rsn>Based on the information provided by VLM, I'm going to take a closer look at the movement of the red cabinet. According to VLM, the red cabinet appears on the left side of the source image and on the right side of the target image. This suggests that the camera has moved to the right, which implies a rightward rotation. The fact that the objects on the countertop remain in a similar arrangement and there are no significant changes in their positions supports this conclusion.</rsn>

<ques>Can you please confirm if the blue couch is in the same position in both images, and if so, is it in the same orientation? Additionally, are there any other objects in the scene that could provide further clues about the camera movement?</ques>"
