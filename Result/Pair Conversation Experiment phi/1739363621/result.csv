The fact that the red cabinets, sink, and countertop are in the same position and design in both images implies that the camera did not move significantly, and the consistent placement of these objects suggests that the camera likely rotated to the right. This is because the sink is on the left side of the countertop in both images, and if the camera rotated to the left, the sink would likely be on the right side of the countertop in the target image.

The television and the desk with a drawer are also present in both images, but their prominence is lower compared to the red shelf and the white sign.

I would like to ask more questions to VLM to gather more information about the positions and movements of the objects in the images. Specifically, I would like to know:

* Are the red shelf and the white sign in the same positions in both images, or have they moved?
* Are the television and the desk with a drawer in the same positions in both images, or have they moved?

Since the camera movement is not visible, I'm relying on the fact that the objects in the images are not moving or changing positions. If the camera movement was a leftward rotation, I would expect some of the objects to be shifted to the left or appear smaller in the target image compared to the source image. However, since the objects appear to be in the same positions and sizes in both images, I'm more inclined to believe that the camera movement is a rightward rotation.

This makes it difficult to determine any noticeable changes in the positions or orientations of the objects, which are crucial in inferring the camera movement.

Additionally, VLM mentioned that the angle of the shot in the target image makes it difficult to determine the exact position of the headphones and the small white device. This lack of clear information about the objects' movements and positions makes it challenging for me to confidently determine the camera movement.

I need more specific details about the changes in the objects' positions or orientations to make an accurate judgment.","Can you please provide more information about the specific changes in the objects' positions or orientations?

The observations suggest that the headphones are tilted to the right, the small white device is positioned at a different angle, and the keyboard is slightly tilted to the left. These changes collectively imply a rotation or shift in perspective, which is more likely to be a rightward rotation rather than a leftward rotation.

The slight tilts and shifts in the objects' positions and orientations suggest a rotation or shift in perspective, and the rightward tilt of the headphones and the slight tilt of the keyboard support this conclusion.

This is because there is no mention of any objects being closer or farther away from each other, which suggests that the camera has not moved laterally. The fact that the white paper with text remains in the same position relative to the red cabinets and the sink also supports the idea that the camera has rotated slightly to the right.

The VLM states that the coffee machines and countertops appear to be in the same location in both images, which suggests that the camera did not move horizontally or vertically. Since the camera movement is limited to a leftward or rightward rotation, and the objects are in the same location, it is likely that the camera rotated leftward. The fact that the coffee machines are on the left side of the countertop in both images also supports this conclusion, as it would be unusual for the camera to rotate rightward and the objects to remain in the same position.

The VLM's description suggests that the positions of the objects, including the red cabinets, wooden chairs, countertop, and white cup, are consistent between the source and target images. This consistency implies that the camera did not move significantly in any direction, including translation. Since the camera movement is limited to a leftward or rightward rotation, and the objects are in the same relative positions, I infer that the camera rotated rightward to capture the target image.

The fact that the left cabinet is still closer to the foreground and the right cabinet is further back in both images suggests that the camera did not move significantly in the left-right direction. The consistent positions of the wooden chairs and the countertop also support the idea of a rotation, as they would not remain in the same positions if the camera had moved in a leftward direction.

Although the Dispensers are not aligned in a specific direction, the fact that they are more spread out in the target image compared to the source image suggests that the camera has moved slightly to the right. This is because the Dispensers appear to be more evenly distributed across the image in the target image, which is consistent with a rightward rotation.

Additionally, the fact that the Dispensers are not aligned in a specific direction in both images suggests that the camera movement is more likely to be a rotation rather than a translation. If the camera had moved leftward, the Dispensers would likely be more concentrated on the left side of the image in the target image, which is not the case.

Given that the blinds on the window are partially open in both images and it's not clear if they have moved, I'm going to assume that they are in the same position. This further supports the idea that the camera movement is rotating around the center of the room.

Taking all this information into account, I'm going to take a confident stance and say that the main camera movement from the source image to the target image is a leftward rotation. This is because the objects in the scene, particularly the backpack and bulletin board, suggest that the camera has rotated around the center of the room, and the direction of this rotation is leftward.

office,seq-03,000747-000787,phi,leftward,25.804024,1,0,Next Round,"I'm not confident enough to judge the main camera movement from the source image to the target image yet. Although VLM provided information about the main objects, I would like to know more about the positions of these objects in both images. For example, are the office chairs, desks, computers, and backpacks in the same relative positions in both images, or have they moved or rotated?

I'd like to ask VLM some follow-up questions to gather more information before making a judgment about the camera movement. Here's my next question:","Can you tell me more about the positions of the office chairs, desks, computers, and backpacks in both the source and target images? For example, are they aligned with each other, or are they at an angle? Are there any specific objects that have moved or changed position between the two images?"
office,seq-03,000747-000787,phi,leftward,25.804024,2,2,rightward,"Based on the information provided by VLM, I'm very confident that the main camera movement from the source image to the target image is a rightward rotation. The key observation that led me to this conclusion is the movement of the backpack from the right side of the desk to the left side. This suggests that the camera has rotated to the right, allowing the backpack to move from the right to the left side of the desk.

Additionally, the fact that the office chair remains to the left and the desk remains in the same relative position to the backpack and the computer also supports the idea of a rightward rotation. If the camera had rotated to the left, the office chair would likely be facing the computer or the desk, which is not the case.

Overall, the combination of the backpack's movement and the stability of the other objects in the scene strongly suggests a rightward rotation of the camera.",None
fire,seq-02,000049-000184,phi,rightward,20.188966,1,1,leftward,"Based on the information provided by VLM, I am very confident that the main camera movement from the source image to the target image is leftward rotation. The VLM mentioned that the caution sign and the fire extinguisher box are positioned in the same relative location in both images, which suggests that the camera has moved leftward. This is because the objects would have to move to the right in the image if the camera were rotating rightward, which is not the case. Additionally, the VLM mentioned that the camera movement is likely leftward, which further supports my conclusion.",None

By analyzing the position changes of these objects, I can infer that the camera is rotating leftward from the source image to the target image. The yellow caution sign moves from the right side of the source image to the left side of the target image, the red fire extinguisher box moves from the left side of the source image to the right side of the target image, and the black plant pot with the green plant moves from the right side of the source image to the left side of the target image. This movement pattern suggests that the camera is rotating leftward to capture the objects in the target image.",None

Although the VLM mentioned that the camera is rotating upward from the source image to the target image, this information doesn't provide any information about the direction of rotation. The camera could be rotating upward and to the left, or upward and to the right. To determine the direction of rotation, I would like to know more about the position of the camera in relation to the objects in the scene.

The VLM's description of the camera moving upward and the objects in the scene appearing to move towards the camera suggests that the camera is rotating upward, but the VLM also mentions that the camera is changing from a more horizontal to a more vertical angle. This implies that the camera is rotating around its vertical axis, which would result in a rightward rotation. The fact that the camera is not rotating leftward is not explicitly mentioned, but the description of the camera movement is consistent with a rightward rotation.",None
