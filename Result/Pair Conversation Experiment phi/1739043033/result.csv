office,seq-03,000740-000766,phi,leftward,18.843645,1,0,Next Round,"I'm not confident enough to judge the main camera movement from the source image to the target image based on the information provided by VLM. Although we have identified the main objects that appear in both images, we don't have enough information about their positions and movements to infer the camera rotation.

To gather more information, I'd like to ask VLM some follow-up questions to help us better understand the spatial relationships between the objects in the source and target images.","Can you please tell me more about the position of the backpack in the source and target images? Is it in the same location, or has it moved to a different part of the room?

Additionally, can you describe the position of the framed picture or poster on the wall in both images? Is it in the same location, or has it shifted slightly?

Lastly, are there any other objects or features in the scene that could provide clues about the camera movement?"
pumpkin,seq-01,000689-000723,phi,rightward,19.127966,1,0,Next Round,"The information provided by VLM is limited to the presence of common objects, but it doesn't give us any information about their positions or movements within the images. Since we can't determine the exact movement of the camera based on the provided information, I'm not confident enough to make a judgment. I would like to ask more questions to VLM to gather more details about the positions and movements of the objects within the images.","Can you please describe the positions of the stove, dishwasher, and red cabinets in the source image? Are they aligned in a specific way, such as in a row or in a corner? And how do their positions change in the target image? Are they still aligned in the same way, or have they moved relative to each other?"
pumpkin,seq-06,000884-000918,phi,leftward,22.888267,1,0,Next Round,"Although the VLM provided information about the main objects in both images, I'm not confident enough to judge the camera movement yet. I would like to ask more questions to gather more information about the positions and movements of the objects. Specifically, I'd like to know more about the relative positions of the cabinets and the countertop in the source and target images. Are the cabinets and countertop in the same position in both images, or have they moved? Are there any other objects that have changed positions or orientation between the two images? This additional information will help me better understand the camera movement and make a more informed judgment.",Can you please provide more information about the positions and movements of the cabinets and the countertop in the source and target images? Are there any other objects that have changed positions or orientation between the two images?
office,seq-07,000175-000208,phi,leftward,20.000744,1,0,Next Round,"Since the VLM mentioned that the positioning of the objects remains consistent between the two images, it suggests that there is no significant rotation of the camera from the source to the target image. Additionally, the VLM did not mention any specific objects that are distinctly common to both images that would indicate a clear direction of camera movement.

I'm not confident enough to judge the main camera movement from the source image to the target image based on the provided information. To gather more information, I'd like to ask some follow-up questions to the VLM. Can you please tell me more about the desk and its position in both images? Is the desk in the same location, or has it moved slightly?",None
pumpkin,seq-06,000889-000930,phi,leftward,25.754703,1,0,Next Round,"Although we know the main objects that appear in both images, we still need more information about their positions and movements to determine the camera movement. For example, are the red cabinets, black countertop, stainless steel sink, and green and black coffee machine in the same relative positions in both images? Are they rotated or translated? We need more details to make an accurate judgment. Therefore, I'm not confident enough to judge the main camera movement from the source image to the target image and would like to ask additional questions to VLM to gather more information.","Can you please ask VLM:

""Are the red cabinets, black countertop, stainless steel sink, and green and black coffee machine in the same relative positions in both images? If not, how have they changed?"""
