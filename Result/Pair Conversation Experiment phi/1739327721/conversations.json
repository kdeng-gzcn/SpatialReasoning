Since there are no moving objects or linear features that could indicate a direction of movement, I'm focusing on the possibility of a rotational movement. Given that the objects are present in both images, it's more likely that the camera has rotated leftward rather than rightward, as the objects would be distorted or occluded if the camera had rotated rightward.

The objects' positions are similar in both images, which suggests that the camera might not have moved much. However, I'd like to ask more questions to VLM to gather more information before making a judgment. For example, are the objects in the source image aligned with the same axis as in the target image? Are there any other distinctive features in the images that could help me infer the camera movement? Additionally, I'd like to know more about the figure on the poster and its position in both images. Is it possible that the camera movement is related to the figure's orientation or position? By asking more questions, I hope to gather more clues that will help me make a more confident judgment about the camera movement.Can you please tell me more about the figure on the poster and its position in both images?

He said, \"The figure on the poster appears to be a person wearing a helmet, possibly a pilot or astronaut, given the context of the image which seems to be an office or a study room. In the source image, the figure is positioned to the left side of the poster, while in the target image, the figure is slightly to the right. This suggests a slight rightward movement of the camera from the source to the target image. The objects in the source image, such as the desk, chair, and computer, are aligned with the same axis as in the target image, indicating that the camera movement is minimal. There are no other distinctive features in the images that could provide additional clues about the camera movement. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is likely that the camera moved slightly rightward from the source image to the target image.\" Based on this, please choose one of the following options to determine the main camera movement from the source image to the target image: (0) Not confident enough to judge; (1) Leftward rotation; (2) Rightward rotation.

Although you can't see the pair of images directly, you have a friend Vision Language Model (VLM) who can answer all the questions that you ask about the images. My suggestions are: 1. to find out the main objects occur in both images; 2. find out the positions of the objects inside the image, e.g. there is a box on the left side of source image, and the same box is on the right side of target image; 3. judge the movement of camera from source image to target image based on information you get. For more information: 1. you can have several turns of conversation with VLM if you like; 2. the task is not hard because the camera movement is only by one of six direction (three translations and three rotations), and here you just need to judge if the camera is rotating leftward or rightward from source to target. Now suppose you are chatting with your friend, formulate questions for your friend. "

The backpack has moved from the left side of the room to a slightly more central location, which suggests that the camera has rotated to the right. This movement is consistent with a rightward rotation, which would bring the backpack into view from a more central perspective.\n\nThe fact that the backpack is still on the floor and hasn't changed elevation or orientation suggests that the camera movement is a rotation rather than a translation or a combination of both. Additionally, the movement of the backpack is subtle, which implies that the camera movement is also relatively subtle, consistent with a rotation rather than a more dramatic movement."
