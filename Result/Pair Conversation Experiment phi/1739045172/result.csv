pumpkin,seq-06,000934-000961,phi,leftward,16.067464,1,1,leftward,"The fact that the main objects, such as the red cabinets, sink with a faucet, and countertop, are present in both images suggests that the camera movement is likely a rotation. Since the objects are common to both images, it's possible that the camera rotated around a fixed axis, which would cause the objects to appear in different positions. 

Given that the camera movement is limited to a leftward or rightward rotation, I'm going to take a guess that the camera rotated rightward. This is because the objects in the source image are likely to be on the left side of the camera, and after the rotation, they would appear on the right side of the camera in the target image. For example, the red cabinets might be on the left side of the source image and appear on the right side of the target image. This would suggest a rightward rotation.

However, I'm not 100% confident in my answer, so I'd like to ask VLM a follow-up question to confirm my hypothesis. Here's my next question:","Can you tell me the position of the red cabinets in the source image and their position in the target image?

However, since the camera movement is limited to a leftward or rightward rotation, I'm going to take a closer look at the positions of the objects.

VLM mentioned that the sink with a faucet, countertop, red cabinet, and paper with text on it are consistent in both images. This means that these objects are not moving or changing positions. If the camera is not moving or changing its position, it's likely that the rotation is the primary camera movement.

Given that the objects are consistent, I'm going to assume that the camera is rotating around the center of the scene. Since the objects are not changing positions, it's likely that the rotation is around the vertical axis (leftward or rightward).

Considering this, I'm going to take a guess that the camera is rotating rightward. This is because, in many scenes, objects tend to move to the right when the camera rotates rightward, and vice versa. Although this is not a hard rule, it's a common observation in many scenes.

Can you please tell me more about the positions of the red countertops and white display stands in the source and target images? For example, are they in the same relative positions, or have they moved? Are there any other visual cues, such as shadows or reflections, that could help me infer the camera movement?",None

The static objects mentioned, such as furniture and office equipment, do not provide any information about the movement of the camera. Therefore, I'm not confident enough to judge the direction of camera movement yet. I would like to ask more questions to VLM to gather more information.","Can you tell me, VLM, if there are any objects in the source image that are not present in the target image, or vice versa? Are there any objects that have changed their position or orientation between the two images? Are there any objects that are partially occluded or hidden in one of the images?"

Although we know the main objects that appear in both images, we don't have any information about the positions of these objects in the source and target images. For example, are the red cabinets on the left side of the source image and on the right side of the target image? Are the blue sofa and sink in the same position or have they moved? Without this information, it's difficult to determine if the camera is rotating leftward or rightward. Therefore, I need more details to make an accurate judgment.","Can you tell me more about the positions of the objects in the source and target images?

Although VLM mentioned that the orientation and size of the main objects appear to be consistent between the source and target images, this doesn't provide enough information to determine the camera movement.

I would like to ask more questions to VLM to gather more information about the positions and movements of the objects in the images. For example, I could ask:

""Can you tell me more about the position of the backpack in the source and target images? Is it in the same location, or has it moved? Are there any other objects that have changed position or orientation between the two images?""

By asking more questions, I hope to gather more specific information about the camera movement and make a more informed judgment.",None
office,seq-07,000241-000273,phi,leftward,18.829098,1,1,leftward,"The main objects that occur in both images, such as computer desks, chairs, computer monitors, papers or documents, cables, a window with blinds, and a wall with a poster or artwork, suggest that the camera movement is likely a rotation around the central axis of the room. Since the objects are present in both images, it implies that the camera did not move horizontally or vertically. Given that the camera movement is limited to a leftward or rightward rotation, I'm going to take a confident guess that the camera rotated leftward from the source image to the target image. The fact that the VLM mentioned ""possibly leftward or rightward"" also leans me towards choosing option (1) Leftward rotation. However, I would like to ask additional questions to VLM to further confirm my judgment.","Could you please provide more information about the positions of the objects in the source and target images? For example, is the computer desk on the left side of the source image and on the right side of the target image? Are the chairs facing the same direction in both images?
