Since the objects are common to both images, it's possible that the camera rotated around a fixed axis, which would cause the objects to appear in different positions. \n\nGiven that the camera movement is limited to a leftward or rightward rotation, I'm going to take a guess that the camera rotated rightward. This is because the objects in the source image are likely to be on the left side of the camera, and after the rotation, they would appear on the right side of the camera in the target image. For example, the red cabinets might be on the left side of the source image and appear on the right side of the target image. This would suggest a rightward rotation.\n\nHowever, I'm not 100% confident in my answer, so I'd like to ask VLM a follow-up question to confirm my hypothesis. Here's my next question:\n\n<ques>Can you tell me the position of the red cabinets in the source image and their position in the target image? For example, are they on the left side of the source image and the right side of the target image, or are they in a different position?"

This means that these objects are not moving or changing positions. If the camera is not moving or changing its position, it's likely that the rotation is the primary camera movement.\n\nGiven that the objects are consistent, I'm going to assume that the camera is rotating around the center of the scene. Since the objects are not changing positions, it's likely that the rotation is around the vertical axis (leftward or rightward).\n\nConsidering this, I'm going to take a guess that the camera is rotating rightward. This is because, in many scenes, objects tend to move to the right when the camera rotates rightward, and vice versa. Although this is not a hard rule, it's a common observation in many scenes.\n\nI'm fairly confident in my answer, but if I'm wrong, I'd love to ask more questions to VLM to clarify the positions and movements of the objects."

Since the sink is present in both images, it's likely that the camera rotated around the sink to get to the target image. Given that the red cabinets and countertop are also present in both images, it's reasonable to assume that the camera rotated to the right to move from the source image to the target image. This is because the sink and other objects would likely move to the right if the camera rotated rightward, which would place the sink in its new position in the target image.</rsn>"

However, the fact that the trash bin and backpack/bag are still present on the floor in both images implies that the camera didn't move significantly in the horizontal direction. This leads me to focus on the vertical axis, where the objects are likely to have moved due to the rotation.\n\nGiven that the objects are common to both images, I'm going to infer that the camera rotated rightward to capture the target image.

This is because the main objects that appear in both images are static and don't indicate any dynamic movement. Since the camera movement is limited to a leftward or rightward rotation, I'm going to focus on the positions of the objects.\n\nFrom the description, I know that the desk with papers and a computer monitor, the chair, the bookshelf, and the framed picture or poster on the wall are all present in both images. I'm going to assume that these objects are not moved or repositioned in the target image, which means that the camera movement must be a rotation.\n\nGiven that the objects are static, I'm going to infer that the camera movement is a rotation around a fixed axis. Since the objects are not moved or repositioned, it's likely that the rotation is around the vertical axis (i.e., a rotation around the axis perpendicular to the image plane). This would cause the objects to appear to move to the right in the target image.\n\nTherefore, I'm going to take a confident guess that the camera has moved rightward from the source image to the target image.</rsn>"

Since the orientation of the vending machines is consistent between the two images, it suggests that the camera has rotated around the vertical axis (i.e., a rotation) rather than translated horizontally. Given that the vending machines are on the left side in both images, it's likely that the camera has rotated to the right to move from the source to the target image. This is because if the camera were to rotate to the left, the vending machines would be on the right side in the target image, which is not the case.

Since the kitchen appliances, specifically the coffee machine and soda dispenser, are placed on a countertop in both images, it's likely that the camera is rotating around the vertical axis (leftward or rightward) rather than translating or rotating around other axes. Given that the objects are placed on a countertop, it's unlikely that the camera is translating left or right, as this would result in the objects being moved off the countertop. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is that the camera is rotating leftward, which would keep the objects on the countertop in a similar position in both images.</rsn>\n\nHowever, I would like to ask VLM an additional question to further confirm my judgment:\n\n<ques>Can you please tell me if the relative positions of the coffee machine and soda dispenser have changed in the target image compared to the source image? For example, is the coffee machine still on the left side of the soda dispenser in the target image, or has it moved to the right side?</ques>"

Any additional details about the object positions and movements would be helpful in making a more informed judgment about the camera movement."

Since the red cabinets are consistent in both images, I'm going to focus on the stove, dishwasher, and sink. If the camera were to rotate leftward, the stove, dishwasher, and sink would likely move to the right side of the image. Since the VLM didn't mention any significant changes in their positions, I'm inclined to think that the camera might have rotated rightward, which would cause these objects to move to the left side of the image. This is a educated guess, but I'm choosing option 1 because it seems more plausible based on the information provided.</rsn>\n\nHowever, I'm not 100% confident in my answer, so I'd like to ask VLM a few more questions to clarify the situation.
