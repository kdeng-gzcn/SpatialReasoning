My reasoning is based on the assumption that if the camera rotated leftward, we would likely see the objects in a different arrangement or orientation in the target image. Since the objects appear to be in a similar arrangement and orientation, I'm leaning towards a rightward rotation.

However, the presence of a green object (water dispenser or coffee machine) on the right side of the target image and the absence of it in the source image suggests that the camera has rotated to the left. This is because the object has moved from the left side of the image to the right side, which can only be achieved through a leftward rotation. Additionally, the presence of a white object (dishwasher or washing machine) on the right side of the target image also supports the idea of a leftward rotation, as it would be difficult to explain its presence on the right side without the camera rotating to the left.","Can you please tell me more about the positions of the sink, countertop, and red cabinets in the source and target images?

From the description, I notice that the backpack is present in both images. Since VLM didn't mention any changes in its position, I can infer that the backpack is likely to be in the same relative position in both images. This suggests that the camera rotation is likely to be around the vertical axis (i.e., a rotation around the y-axis), which would cause the backpack to move in a circular motion.

Given that the backpack is likely to be in the same relative position, I'm going to assume that the camera rotation is more likely to be a rightward rotation, as this would cause the backpack to move in a circular motion in a clockwise direction. This is a reasonable assumption, as a leftward rotation would cause the backpack to move in a counterclockwise direction, which might be less likely given the absence of other significant changes in the scene.

The objects mentioned, such as the coffee machine, coffee dispenser, and sink with a faucet, are all located in a kitchen setting with red cabinets and a black countertop. However, without knowing the specific positions of these objects within the images, I cannot infer the direction of rotation. I would like to ask VLM some follow-up questions to gather more information before making a judgment.","Can you please tell me more about the positions of these objects within the images? For example, is the coffee machine located on the left or right side of the sink in the source image, and is it in the same position or has it moved in the target image? Similarly, what about the coffee dispenser and the faucet? Are they in the same position or have they moved between the two images?"
office,seq-08,000317-000349,phi,leftward,25.120151,1,1,leftward,"Based on the information provided by VLM, I'm going to take a confident guess that the camera rotated leftward from the source image to the target image. The fact that the office chair in the foreground of the source image is similar to the one in the target image, but with a different angle and position, suggests that the camera moved to the left to capture the chair from a different perspective. This, combined with the varying arrangement of desks and computer monitors, implies that the camera rotated to the left to capture the scene from a new angle.",None

The objects mentioned (- Sink, Countertop, Dispenser, Machine) are not descriptive enough to determine the direction of rotation. I would like to ask more questions to VLM to gather more information about the positions and movements of these objects in the images.","VLM, can you please provide more details about the positions of these objects in the source and target images? For example, is the sink on the left or right side of the countertop in the source image, and is it on the left or right side of the countertop in the target image?

The information provided is limited, and I would like to ask more questions to VLM to gather more details before making a decision. For instance, I would like to know if there are any subtle changes in the position of the objects, such as slight shifts or tilts, that could indicate a rotation. Additionally, I would like to know if there are any other objects or features in the scene that could provide clues about the camera movement.","Can you please tell me if there are any subtle changes in the position of the objects, such as slight shifts or tilts, between the source and target images?

We need more information about the positions of the heads in the source and target images. For example, are the heads facing the same direction or not? Are they tilted or rotated in the target image compared to the source image? We need more details to make an accurate judgment about the camera movement.

Let's ask VLM some more questions to gather more information!","Hey VLM, can you tell me the orientation of the mannequin heads in the source image? Are they facing the same direction or not? And how about in the target image? Are they facing the same direction or not?"

The objects mentioned, such as the coffee machine and sinks, are man-made and can be moved or rearranged in the scene. Without knowing their exact positions and movements in both images, it's difficult to determine the camera movement. I would like to ask additional questions to gather more information about the objects' positions and movements before making a judgment.","Can you please provide more details about the positions of the coffee machine and sinks in both the source and target images?

This suggests that the camera rotation was relatively small and did not result in a large change in the orientation of the objects. Since the objects are consistent, it is likely that the camera rotation was to the right, as a leftward rotation would have resulted in a more significant change in the positioning of the objects. Therefore, I am confident that the camera movement was a rightward rotation.",None
