heads,seq-01,000208-000242,phi,leftward,15.349436,0,leftward,"The source image shows two white mannequin heads on a desk with a notepad and a pen, while the target image shows the same scene but with the mannequin on the right appearing slightly larger and more in focus than the one on the left. This suggests that the camera has moved closer to the right mannequin, making it appear larger and more prominent in the frame. The left mannequin appears smaller and less in focus, indicating it is further away from the camera. Therefore, the main camera movement is leftward.",None

The camera appears to have moved leftward to capture the image, as the angle of the room and the position of objects such as the couch and the counter have changed. Additionally, the lighting and the reflections on the glass door suggest a different time of day or a change in the camera's position.",None
redkitchen,seq-04,000362-000396,phi,rightward,15.017103,1,no movement,"The source image and the target image appear to be taken from the same angle and perspective, with no noticeable changes in the position of objects or the camera's viewpoint. The main difference is the presence of a small object on the right side in the target image, which is not present in the source image. However, this does not indicate any significant camera movement, as it could be a result of the object being moved or the camera focusing on a different part of the scene.",None
